# OpenMusic.Vue

## The first front end for my music web app project
This Vue web-app will consume my OpenMusic.API, as I develop the app I expect the API will change alongside it.

### Project goals
- [ ] Allow users to register accounts and login
- [ ] Provide functionality for users to interact with all the existing API endpoints to carry out CRUD operations
- [ ] Provide meaningful error messages to the user
- [ ] Provide a responsive layout with loading animations

## Running this project
For now this project will be interacting with the API when it is running locally, the API is not currently deployed so if you wish to use this you will either have to deploy or run the API yourself.
To run the front-end locally you simply need to clone the repository and open it in VSCode or a simmilar application.
- Open a new terminal and write ```npm run serve```
- The project should now be running locally at the address listed in the terminal
